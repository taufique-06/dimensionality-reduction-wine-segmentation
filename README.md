# Dimensionality-reduction (Wine-segmentation)
This project applies dimensionality reduction techniques to a wine dataset in order to simplify feature space while preserving the most informative variance in the data. It explores methods such as 
1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
