# dimensionality-reduction-wine-segmentation
This project applies dimensionality reduction techniques to a wine dataset in order to simplify feature space while preserving the most informative variance in the data. It explores methods such as 
1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
2. 

## PCA Results
